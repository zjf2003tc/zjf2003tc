Hi, my name is Zach Friedman. 

I am a Master's Student studying Learning Analytics at Teachers College, Columbia University.

I am interested in the intersection between data science and education, especially as it relates to EdTech products that have a focus on improving equity. 

I enjoy working on model design, implementation, and interpretation. I like thinking about the implications of data insights and how they can be applied in an organization.
